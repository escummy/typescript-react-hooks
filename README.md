## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy on a live system and clone the repository.

<br>

- (Option 1): Clone the repository with link "https"

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/escummy/typescript-react-hooks.git
```

- (Option 2): Clone the repository with link "SSH"

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:escummy/typescript-react-hooks.git
```

- (Option 3): Download the file.zip to your desktop

<br>

### # Prerequisites

To continue, you need to have installed: `Node`

<br>

(Check in your terminal bash)

```
node --version
```

<br>

Else, Install nodejs from the official site 'version LTS' (Recommended)

[English] - https://nodejs.org/en/ (or) [Spanish] - https://nodejs.org/es/

<br>

## Installing dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies and devDependencies from any package.json

```bash
  npm install
```

<br>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

> Runs the app in the development mode.\
> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
> > The page will reload if you make edits.\
> > You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```
npm test
````

<br>

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```
npm run build
````

<br>

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

> The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
> Your app is ready to be deployed!
> > See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

<br>

```
npm run eject
```

<br>

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
> Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

Recomendations: 
- Check this visual studio code [settings.json](https://github.com/escummy/vscode-settings-json)
- To install the necessary extensions, add 'missing extensions' to your vscode

<br>

<!-- ### # Check status

- Run `Watch`: Which just watches for changes and still does development compiling, it shows any console.log declared for example

```bash
  npm run watch
```

This will launch a web browser that will auto-update every time you save a watched file as(#specify-files-to-watch), but before push to production, we recommend minify the outputs files and caching how this purpose package helper [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) -->

## Latest releases

<!-- Change link path for each repository (automate actions CI/gist)-->

Repositories use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning, three-digit numbering technique based patter of Major, Minor and Patch fixes, see the [release tags](https://github.com/escummy/typescript-react-hooks/tags) for more details about version available.

<!-- ## Running the tests

The code is tested by 'Jest' including unit-test and global-test, applying documentation from continuous integration, github actions, npm datalog-metrics and Travis-CI

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
npm test
```

### And coding style tests
